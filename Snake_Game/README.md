called Snake. As the snake eats food, its length and score increases. This is the fundamental game objective.

3. Press Start.
4. Move the snake around the screen towards the food by pressing the arrows(up,down,left,right) on the  keyboard.
5. If you want the snake to move faster keep the key pressed.
6. Every time the snake eats food, score increases by 5.
6. If you wish to pause the game press the pause button,and when you are ready to resume it, press the resume button.
7. Obstacles will randomly appear on the screen, and if the snake head touches those, the game snake will die and the game will end.
8. If the snake head touches the edges of the screen, the game will end.

10. After the game ends, a list of your all time scores will appear and the game terminates itself after 7 seconds.
