# 2022 Combined COMP1005/COMP1006/COMP1007 Programming Portfolio

## Introduction

In this coursework, you will develop C programs which combines aspects of all *three* COMP1005, COMP 1006 and COMP1007 modules. This program will be a TCP/IP server that implements the version of Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the next hop across a network of networks.

The coursework is broken down into *three* parts. In the first part, you will implement a graph library using a linked lists as presented in COMP1005. In the second part, you will implement the Dijkstra’s algorithm as presented in COMP1006. In the third part, you will develop a TCP/IP server that is able to respond to queries about what the next-hop should be to access one network from another.
